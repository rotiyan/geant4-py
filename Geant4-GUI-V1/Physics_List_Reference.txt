High energy physics calorimetry

Recommended: FTFP_BERT, QGSP_BERT

 

Studies of testbeam data currently show that a string model coupled to a cascade model is needed for a good description of hadronic showers; the FTFP_BERT and QGSP_BERT physics lists improve agreement with LHC testbeam data for the longitudinal shape, the lateral shape and for resolution. These lists are currently chosen by the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS as default physics lists.
